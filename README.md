# RL in a Nutshell

Reinforcement learning focuses on teaching agents through trial and error.

## Applications:
- Autonomous Driving
- Securities Trading
- Neural Network Architecture Search
- Simulated Training of Robots
- and much more


## Limitations and Considerations
- for simple problems, RL can be overkill
- Assumes the environment is Markovian
- Training can take a long time and is not always stable

# Setup
 
## Installing Requred Dependencies

```
pip install stable_baselines3[extra]
```
